Cücü is a one button mobile game I've made in Unity. It is **not** finished. I was inspired by a flash game that I saw like 10 years ago.

The game is based on a Turkish folk figure called [Battal Gazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battal_Gazi). There are numerous films about Battal Gazi and he is often portrayed by Cüneyt Arkın.

I made the pixel art aswell.
